# expression-parser
CSCI 2041 Advanced Programming Principles Final Project 

## Project Overview 
Construct a language consisting of defined expressions and operations. Then, develop a parser which handles type chacking, expression evaluation, the computation of free variables, and expression parsing

Type checking is implemented through the creation of predetermined, mutable type environments

Expression evaluation supports arithmetic expressions, logical and relational expressions, conditional expressions, let expressions, non-recursive, and recursive functions

The parser is written in OCaml and utilizes the concept of programs as data within functional programming
